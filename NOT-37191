AMS1 COGENT (AS174) 100G UPGRADE- CROSS CONNECT 1-233483165830

1) new PAID and PAIDv6 session for Cogent AS174, 1x100G link
2) new LAG and new BGP sessions
2A) if you have questions about how to set up BGP, check existing LAG ae23 for Cogent 2x10G
3) AMS1-PR01 ET-0/0/31
4) ports allocation sheet has the circuit ID, cross connect and name of provider
5) if BGP sessions do not come UP, let me know, I asked service delivery if we need to call the support line to have them Unshut BGP on COgent side, this is how they do it in USA but waiting on directions for Europe
6) we will discuss Undrain timing after BGP is UP
